# Lanimfe Bank Models
This is a simple application that allows you get some interesting structure factors like Hard Sphere between others.

## Getting Started
There are two ways to use this application one of them is using of the menu guide, you can use the menu as follows
## Easy way
Open terminal in this source path and execute using the command
```
./blds

```
and follow the structions.

## A more advanced way
The other way to use this application is by giving parameters. This paramaters are options that allows you use
severals options that you can use for interact with the structures factors and their results.

For example if you type
```
./blds HS

``` 
the process for calculate the Hard Spheere structure factor executes.


**Here are the differents options that you can execute with this programm.**

```
./blds HS

```
*Executes the process for calculate the Hard Sphere structure factor*


```
./blds SS

```
*Executes the process for calculate the Soft Sphere structure factor*

```
./blds Yuk

```
*Executes the process for calculate the Yukawa 3D structure factor*


```
./blds plot HS

```
*Plot the Data of Hard Spheere Structure Factor*

```
./blds plot SS

```
*Plot the Data of Soft Spheere Structure Factor*

```
./blds plot Yuk

```
*Plot the Data of Yukawa 3D Structure Factor*

```
./blds print HS

```
*Print the Data of Hard Spheere Structure Factor*


```
./blds print SS

```
*Print the Data of Soft Spheere Structure Factor*


```
./blds print Yuk

```
*Print the Data of Yukawa 3D Structure Factor*


```
./blds dir

```
* List all the files avaible of the structures factors*

##Special Notes

You can edit certains properties about the structures factors like volumen fractions if you edit the files
of the config directory.
