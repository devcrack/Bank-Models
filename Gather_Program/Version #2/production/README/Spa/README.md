# Lanimfe Bank Models
This is a simple suit that allows you get some interesting structure factors like Hards Spheere between others.

## Getting Started
There are two ways to use this application one of them is using of the menu guide, you can use this of the following way
## Easy way
Open terminal in this source path and execute using the command
```
./blds

```
and follow the structions.

## A more advanced way 
This program contains severals options that you can use for interact with the structures factors and their results.

For example if you type
```
./blds HS

```
the process for calculate the Hard Spheere structure factor executes.


**Here are the differents options that you can execute with this programm.**

```
./blds HS

```
*Executes the process for calculate the Hard Sphere structure factor*


```
./blds SS

```
*Executes the process for calculate the Soft Sphere structure factor*

```
./blds Yuk

```
*Executes the process for calculate the Yukawa 3D structure factor*


```
./blds plot HS

```
*Plot the Data of Hard Spheere Structure Factor*

```
./blds plot SS

```
*Plot the Data of Soft Spheere Structure Factor*

```
./blds plot Yuk

```
*Plot the Data of Yukawa 3D Structure Factor*

```
./blds print HS

```
*Print the Data of Hard Spheere Structure Factor*


```
./blds print SS

```
*Print the Data of Soft Spheere Structure Factor*


```
./blds print Yuk

```
*Print the Data of Yukawa 3D Structure Factor*


```
./blds dir

```
* List all the files avaible of the structures factors*

##Special Notes

You can edit certains properties about the structures factors like volumen fractions if you edit the files
of the config directory.
