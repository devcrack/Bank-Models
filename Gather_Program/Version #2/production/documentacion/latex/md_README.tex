This is a simple suit that allows you get some interesting structure factors like Hards Spheere between others.

\subsection*{Getting Started}

There are two ways to use this application one of them is using of the menu guide, you can use this of the following way \subsection*{Easy way}

Open terminal in this source path and execute using the command 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds
\end{DoxyCode}
 and follow the structions.

\subsection*{A more advanced way}

This program contains severals options that you can use for interact with the structures factors and their results.

For example if you type 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds HS
\end{DoxyCode}
 the process for calculate the Hard Spheere structure factor executes.

{\bfseries Here are the differents options that you can execute with this programm.}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds HS
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Executes the process for calculate the Hard Sphere structure factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds SS
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Executes the process for calculate the Soft Sphere structure factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds Yuk
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Executes the process for calculate the Yukawa 3D structure factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds plot HS
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Plot the Data of Hard Spheere Structure Factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds plot SS
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Plot the Data of Soft Spheere Structure Factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds plot Yuk
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Plot the Data of Yukawa 3D Structure Factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds print HS
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Print the Data of Hard Spheere Structure Factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds print SS
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Print the Data of Soft Spheere Structure Factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds print Yuk
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\itshape Print the Data of Yukawa 3D Structure Factor}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 ./blds dir
\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item List all the files avaible of the structures factors$\ast$
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Special Notes}

You can edit certains properties about the structures factors like volumen fractions if you edit the files of the config directory.
